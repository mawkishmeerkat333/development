### Goal and Value of the Application

The trip planner allows a user to peruse SC state parks by region and wifi availability and add tickets to see how much the trip would cost per adult. Want to plan a mountain getaway free from wifi and work? You can do that. Want to find a park where you can work remotely from the beach? You can do that too.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
